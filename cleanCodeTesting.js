// TESTING

// There is no excuse not to write exams and be sure you haven't broken anything. There are many good JS testing frameworks out there, so find one that your team prefers. When you find one that works for your team, try to always write tests for every new feature/module you introduce. If your preferred method is test-driven development (TDD), that's great, but the main point is to make sure you hit your coverage goals before releasing any features or refactoring an existing one.
